## Approach:

One simple approach to solve this problem is to use a hash set (or a dictionary in Python). We can iterate through the array, adding each element to the hash set. If we encounter an element that is already in the hash set, we return True as it means there's a duplicate. If we reach the end of the array without finding any duplicates, we return False.

## Python Code with Comments:

```
def containsDuplicate(nums):
    # Create an empty set to store unique elements
    unique_set = set()
    # Iterate through the array
    for num in nums:
        # If the element is already in the set, it's a duplicate
        if num in unique_set:
            return True
        # Otherwise, add it to the set
        unique_set.add(num)
    # If we reach here, there are no duplicates
    return False
```

## Complexity Analysis:

- Time complexity: O(n) - We iterate through the array once.
- Space complexity: O(n) - In the worst case, when there are no duplicates, we store all elements in the set.

## Alternative Approaches:

- sorting first then two nested loops
  We can also solve this problem using sorting. Sorting the array first would make it easier to identify duplicates.
  Another approach is to use two nested loops to compare each element with all others, but it would have a time complexity of O(n^2) and is less efficient.

## Optimization:

The provided solution with a hash set is already quite efficient for this problem. There's not much room for further optimization.

## Discuss Trade-offs:

The hash set solution has a trade-off between time and space complexity. It uses **extra space** to store unique elements but provides a fast lookup to check for duplicates. If memory usage is a concern, the sorting approach could be used with a space complexity of O(1) but a slightly worse time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting.
